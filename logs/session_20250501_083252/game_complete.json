I also suggested building on this by looking at who has been overly defensive or cautious, as this might indicate hidden motives. Notably, Paul questioned my intentions when I asked to discuss potential alliances and roles without accusing each other blindly.

Leah's proactive role in suggesting we track behaviors and discuss alliances is commendable, yet it also prompts me to wonder if she might be protecting someone.
